Type of Assignment: Lab 2
Problem Number: 3
Programmer: Liliana Pantoja
Section: 400/M40
Date Due: 1/26/2025

Purpose: Write a program that allows the user to enter a number of 
quarters, dimes and nickels and then outputs the monetary of the 
coins in cents.
For example, if the user enters 2 for the number of quarters, 3 for 
the number of dimes, and 3 for the number of nickels, then the 
program should output that the coins are worth 95 cents.
Example Output:
Enter the number of quarters: 2
Enter the number of dims: 3
Enter the number of nickels: 3
You have 95 cents.
